# AINative Studio Branding & Parity Rule

- Replace all instances of `Void`, `Void Editor`, and `Glass Devtools, Inc.` with `AINative Studio` in code, UI, CLI, documentation, and metadata.
- Update all logos, icons, splash screens, and visual assets to AINative Studio-provided PNGs.
- Update documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`) to reference AINative Studio.
    - Add to LICENSE: "Forked from Void Editor, originally based on Visual Studio Code."
- Remove or update all links to `voideditor.com`, Discord, and GitHub `voideditor`.
- Update code comments and annotations:
    - `// Forked from Void` → `// Forked from Void Editor by AINative Studio`
    - `@voideditor` → `@ainativestudio`
- Do **not** change any functional logic, paths, or module names unless branding-dependent.
- Maintain 100% feature parity with the original Void Editor. No new features or regressions allowed.
- All platform builds (macOS, Windows, Linux) must display correct AINative Studio branding and icons.
- Final deliverable must have no visible or referenced use of "Void" or "Glass Devtools, Inc." remaining.
